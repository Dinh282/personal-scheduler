# Personal-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this project, I modify a given starter code using JQuery to dynamically update the HTML and CSS. By doing this poject, I was given the opportunity to explore JQuery and Dayjs, learn to use the tools available in their libraries, and acquire a better understanding of the documentations for these tools. I was able to utilize JQuery and Dayjs by linking the js files on a Content Delivery Network in the script tag. Completion of this project demonstrated how useful JS libraries are; their prewritten JacvaScript code allows me to easily develop my application.
